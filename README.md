# Prime Tables
**An application that, once run, asks for an numeric input (N) and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers**

## How to run

The page is available at https://alequin.github.io/prime_tables/. It can also be run locally using the following steps:

* Requirements
  * Node.js
  * npm / yarn


* Steps to run locally
  1. Install all dependencies using **npm install** or **yarn** in the terminal.
  2. Run webpack using the command **npm run build** to create the bundle
  3. Open the web page in your default browser with **npm start**

## How to use
* At the top of the screen an input box is provided. Enter the amount of prime numbers you wish to generate and press enter / click generate.

* The table will be refreshed using the provided value.

## Aliases

To activate a few aliases for commonly run terminal commands run **source project_aliases.txt** in the terminal. This will only work in the terminal they are activate in.

This will activate the aliases:
* open: Open app in default browser
* tst: Run all tests
* tst-u: Run all tests and update snapshots
* bld: run webpack to build bundle
* clear-project-aliases: remove these aliases
