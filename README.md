#Prime Tables
**An application that, once run, asks for an numeric input (N) and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers**

##How to run

1. Install all dependencies using **npm install** or **yarn** in the terminal.
2. Run webpack using the command **npm run build** to create the bundle
3. Open the web page in your default browser with **npm start**

4. Tests may be run using **npm test**

##How to use
* At the top of the screen an input box is provided. Enter the amount of prime numbers you wish to generate and press enter / click generate.

* The current table will be replaced with a new product table using the value provided in the input box.

##Aliases

To activate a few aliases for commonly run terminal commands run **source project_aliases.txt** in the terminal. This will only work in the terminal they are activate in.

This will activate the aliases:
* open: Open app in default browser
* tst: Run all tests
* tst-u: Run all tests and update snapshots
* bld: run webpack to build bundle
* clear-project-aliases: remove these aliases
